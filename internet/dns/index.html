      <h2>DNS</h2>
      <p>DNS is a very important part of the internet, without it we would have to memorize long string of numbers like this: 192.168.0.1</p>
      <p>DNS stands for Domain Name Server, lets break this name down. A domain name is the first part of a URL, this is anything like "google.com" or "wikipedia.org". Now a computer doesn't know what wikipedia is or where wikipedia is, so it sends a request to a DNS server, who have a very large database of every domain on the internet. This DNS server will return an <a href="https://kylef01.github.io/internet/ip">IP address</a> that leads to wikipedia. However, you may have noticed that I didn't mention anything that has a slash after it like "wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_sandwich", this is because once your computer contacts wikipedia, it has to ask for the "Toast_sandwich" file in the "wiki" folder, just like files on your own computer.</p>
