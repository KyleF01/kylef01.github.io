      <h2>Intro<h2>
      <p>At first glance, the internet must seem like magic, one second you are staring at a blank screen, and within a second or two you could be watching cat videos, or talking to people half way across the world (and without long-distance fees!). But how do computers pull of this seemingly amazing feat?</p>
      <p>I'm about to use some big words here, but hopefully by the time you've read this whole page you will have a good understanding of what this means. For this example, lets pretend you just booted up your computer, and typed "google.com" into your browser. First, your computer checks with a <a href="kylef01.github.io/internet/dns">DNS server</a> because your computer doesn't naturally understand human language. This DNS server takes "google.com" and turns it into an address, called an <a href="kylef01.github.io/internet/ip">IP address</a>. This address acts like home addresses work for us, it tells the computer where it needs to go next. So this computer sends a request to this address, and the <a href="kylef01.github.io/internet/servers">servers</a> at this address present your computer with something called and <a href="kylef01.github.io/internet/html">HTML file</a>, and its accompanying files. The browser then has to take this file, and turns it into something that looks nice to humans like us. Some websites have extra capability, like a live chat, or telling you the weather. This is usually done using a language called <a href="kylef01.github.io/internet/js">JavaScript</a>, this language can be used to make small programs that your computer executes to make the website more interactive.</p>
      <p>If you were confused at any point reading the above text, which I'm almost certain you were, feel free to press one of the links to learn more about a particular topic. Also, remember to click some of the buttons at the top, as some things, like <a href="kylef01.github.io/internet/basics">networking basics</a>, are also important to know about.</p>
