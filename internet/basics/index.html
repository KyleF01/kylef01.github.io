      <h2>Networking Basics</h2>
      <p>So, you just got a new phone, and connected it to your home internet. But have you ever wondered how that connection works? Well it starts at the point your phone connects to, the router. Your router is like your homes "hub" when it comes to internet, your router takes all wireless signals directed at it and then converts them to electrical signals, and sends it to your modem. Your modem takes this electrical signal, then converts to travel across fiber, cable, or phone lines, all depending on what your ISP offers. These lines then connect you to "The Internet" as we know it.</p>
      <p>Each of these different types of cable have their own advantages and disadvantages, lets talk about them!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Let's start with DSL, this is a phone line repurposed for faster internet than dial-up. Its advantage is availability, as most American households have a phone line of some sort. However, DSL is the slowest of the three.</li>
        <li>Next let's talk about cable. As in its name, this shares a cable line with tv to provide you with fast stable internet. This is available in many households, but not all. However it is very stable, and quite fast.</li>
        <li>Last but definitely not least, lets talk about my personal favorite: Fiber! Fiber, unlike DSL and Cable, uses <b>LIGHT</b> to transfer data, this leads to ultra fast speeds, and amazing reliability. However this is an honor reserved usually by businesses, and a few lucky homes.</li>
      </ul>
