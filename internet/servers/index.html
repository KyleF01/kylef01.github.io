      <h2>Servers</h2>
      <p>So your request made its way over to Google's servers, good! It's completed half of its journey... but what now? Well, the server reads your request and serves you the files and accompanying data that goes with it. But, surely it can't be that simple, right? Well, it depends on the type of connection. For example, let's say you just got off of work and booted up your Xbox to play a few rounds of Halo Infinite before chores. How are you able to play with other people online? Well, this is a different type of connection. Instead of serving files, the server and your Xbox send data to each other. This data includes your players location, other players locations, and maybe voice chat data too. This means that the server and your Xbox need a constant connection rather than a one time connection, so with this type of connection, the connection between your Xbox and server is not ended until you log off of Halo.</p>
      <p>Whenever you hear about the cloud, what do you think about? Do you think about some far off magical place? Or maybe the Sky? Well, the cloud is nothing more than a collection of servers that store data, it is important to not think of servers as anything less than giant computers. They operate exactly the same, except they have a lot more storage space so you can upload more pictures of your pets, or your family. In fact, if you wanted to, you could use your own computer as a server.</p>
