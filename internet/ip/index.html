      <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
      <p>So, your computer contacted a DNS server, and now it has an IP address. But what does it do with this IP address? Well, similar to home addresses, you start on the large scale. You cannot go to a street in a different city without first going to that other city.</p>
      <p>First your computer checks itself for if it is the owner of that IP, as computers assign certain IPs to themselves, a common example is "127.0.0.1". If the IP your computer needs to reach isn't there, it goes up one step, and asks your router. Your router checks the list of all devices connected to your home network, and trys to match the IP with a device. Common Network IPs start with "192.168". If your router cannot find it then your router goes up one, and asks your ISP, your ISP would go through this same process until the request makes its way over to its destination server. This destination server would then send a responce down the same chain, from server to ISP, ISP to your router, and finally your router to your computer. Congradulations! Your computer has success fully completed a request. But what would happen if something went wrong? Some common errors are: 404, which means your request successfully made it to the server, but it cannot find the file you need. 5** (the stars are wildcards, they are different numbers), which means that something went wrong, either the server is down, or your ISP is having issues.</p>
